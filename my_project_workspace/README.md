## Compatibility

The current version of the NeSTiNg simulation framework has been tested with OMNeT++ version 5.5.1 and INET version 4.1.2 under Linux.

## Getting Started

+ Follow the instructions as directed from the original author's page.
+ The working project folder is titled "nesting2".
+ The accompanying appendix file located in this same parent folder should aid in supported instructions for this project, and, apart from that, it also documents the errors that were encountered during the installation and development phases of this work. These errors might be common to other researchers and developers working on OMNeT++ and NeSTiNg, that is why the file has been uploaded here - in case it is found to be of use to them.
